# Third-Party-Privacy-Data-Leaks-on-Hospital-Websites
Co-op Research Project | University of Guelph

üîç Objective


This research investigates third-party data leaks on hospital websites, focusing on safeguarding patient data from unauthorized sharing. The study analyzes how hospitals handle user data, particularly the transmission of search terms, URLs, and other personal information to third parties without user consent. By examining the privacy practices of 135 hospital websites in Ontario, this project aims to:

Identify data-sharing patterns and privacy risks
Assess compliance with privacy regulations like PHIPA, PIPEDA, and GDPR
Recommend privacy-enhancing measures to secure sensitive healthcare data

üöÄ Key Contributions


Developed Automated Scripts to simulate user interactions and detect third-party data sharing.
Analyzed Privacy Policies of 135 hospital websites, identifying gaps in transparency and consent mechanisms.
Highlighted data-sharing practices involving third parties like Google, Facebook, and Analytics Tools.
Provided actionable recommendations for strengthening data privacy in the healthcare sector.

üß† Skills Gained


Privacy Risk Assessment: Evaluated data-sharing practices, privacy policies, and compliance with regulations.
Automated Web Analysis: Designed scripts to detect third-party requests and data leaks effectively.
Data Analysis: Interpreted network traffic logs to identify sensitive data exposures.
Regulatory Knowledge: Deep understanding of PHIPA, PIPEDA, and GDPR for data protection.
Research & Reporting: Documented findings in a systematic manner, contributing to academic literature.

‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection
Manual Testing: Visited hospital websites, performed searches, and documented data flows.
Automated Analysis: Created Python scripts to simulate user activity and detect third-party requests.
Privacy Policy Review: Evaluated visibility, accessibility, and content of privacy policies.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Analysis Techniques
Network Monitoring: Tracked real-time data transmission to external servers.
Search Term Tracking: Analyzed whether user search queries were shared without consent.
Comparative Analysis: Benchmarked findings against privacy best practices and legal frameworks.

üß™ Tools & Technologies


Python: For automation scripts and data collection
Web Scraping Libraries: To analyze website structures and detect hidden trackers
Wireshark: For network traffic monitoring
Privacy Policy Analysis Frameworks: To assess data protection compliance

üìà Key Findings


Inconsistent Privacy Practices: Some hospitals shared user data with third parties without explicit consent.
Hidden Data Transfers: Many websites transmitted search terms and URLs to analytics services like Google Analytics.
Gaps in Privacy Policies: Not all websites clearly disclosed their data-sharing practices, raising transparency concerns.

‚úÖ Recommendations


Replace Google Analytics with privacy-friendly tools like Matomo or Piwik PRO.
Implement explicit consent mechanisms for data collection.
Regularly audit third-party services to ensure compliance with privacy regulations.
